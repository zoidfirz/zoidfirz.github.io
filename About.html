                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                        The purpose of the Ronin Shotokan Karate-Do Association (RSKA) is to further the rich martial arts legacy of our instructor and founder, the late Thomas LaPuppet. In addition, our instructional classes are designed to bring affordable training in the fundamentals of Shotokan Karate to youth and adults. It is also our aim to provide training on a grass-roots level to qualify our karate students to compete on local, state and national levels in events that are sanctioned by the USA National Karate-Do Federation (USANKF) which is the current National Governing Body (NGB) for the sport of karate in the United States sanctioned by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). To these ends we engage or plan to engage in the following activities.
