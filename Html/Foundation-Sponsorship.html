                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the Ronin Shotokan Karate-Do Association (RSKA) is to further the rich martial
                    arts legacy of our instructor and founder, the late Thomas LaPuppet. In addition, our
                    instructional classes are designed to bring affordable training in the fundamentals of Shotokan
                    Karate to youth and adults. It is also our aim to provide training on a grass-roots level to qualify
                    our karate students to compete on local, state and national levels in events that are sanctioned
                    by the USA National Karate-Do Federation (USANKF) which is the current National Governing
                    Body (NGB) for the sport of karate in the United States sanctioned by the United States Olympic
                    Committee (USOC).

                <h1>Our Team Profile</h1>
               <p> The competition team, which currently consists of eleven students of karate, train in addition to
                their regular karate classes in order to achieve the level of proficiency that is needed to compete
                at the levels in their division, locally, statewide and nationally. On August 3, 2016 karate was
                approved for inclusion to the 2020 Olympic Program opening the door for International
                competition as Sensei LaPuppet hoped for.<br>
                Although our classes are closely modeled after the training techniques developed by Sensei
                LaPuppet, competition training is a put forth by techniques developed by Sensei Bernard
                Colonel for the express purpose of integrating techniques learned in regular class and elements
                used in active sparring in the competition arena.<br>
                Ronin Shotokan looks to develop limitless, healthy, confident and successful competitors in both
                karate and everyday life. We motivate and hope to create a leadership mentality that will extend
                   into the community at large.</p>

                    <h1>Sponsorship</h1>
                    <p>Thank you, for considering sponsorship of the Ronin Shotokan Karate Competition Team. There
                        are several benefits to sponsor our team’s activities. The number of young people who have
                        involved themselves in karate has increased and the general excitement for the sport received a
                        boost in popularity when on August 3, 2016 karate was approved for inclusion to the 2020
                        Olympics in Japan by the International Olympic Committee.</p>

                          <p>  We hope you see this organization as an opportunity to assist the community and the children
                        and promote your services and products through a sponsorship. All sponsors will receive a
                        receipt for tax-reporting and deduction purposes at the time of donation. We will offer a variety
                        of sponsorship methods to suit your budget. No donation is too small. Every dollar raised goes
                        into the club to help enrich the experience of the athletes.
                          </p>
                    <p>
                        By sponsoring you can position your organization with an attractive demographic. All our
                        athletes are between the ages of 6 - 25 and spend an average of $300 to $500 per year on
                        sporting goods, athletic purchases and tournament fees. Many of our youth’s family members
                        live in the neighborhood and regularly attend our meets. In addition, members often invite
                        friends and other acquaintances from school, out of town guests and other venues. This
                        provides a useful avenue for all categories of advertising opportunities.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        There are several ways to support the team:
